Get a factorial *recursively*

Standard factorial method using recursion, returns 1 if x is less than
or equal to 1, otherwise it returns `factorial(x-1)`.

@param 	x	integer to get the factorial of.
@return x!

Jumble up a string

Currently it doesn't do anything, as the whole method is

	public static String jumble(String toJumble) {
		return toJumble;
	}

However in the possible future, it might do something, something
really cool like. YEAH.

@param 	toJumble	the string you want to jumble
@return toJumble, jumbled up all fancy like.
