# Docify

Docify is a (currently hypothetical) alternative documentation markup reader/creator.

Docify will be made available for multiple programming languages, however the first
language to receive a Docify tool will most likely be Java or Python.

Docify will use markdown inside of multi-line comments as opposed to html (as is the
case with javadoc).


## Paths Scheme

All tests will take place in the tests branch, when a test is determined to be ready
for general use, it will be placed in the master branch.

A tests directory will reside in each language name directory, it will contain a file
with the language's docify specifications inside of it as well as the output from docify.
