# Docify

Docify is a (currently hypothetical) alternative documentation markup reader/creator.

Docify will be made available for multiple programming languages, however the first
language to receive a Docify tool will most likely be Java or Python.

Docify will use markdown inside of multi-line comments as opposed to html (as is the
case with javadoc).
